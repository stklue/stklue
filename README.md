### 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for clean architecture, efficient systems, and solving real problems with code. I enjoy building backend infrastructure and interactive frontends. I believe in learning by doing — most of my skills are backed by projects I've built from scratch.

I'm currently focused on:

- 📚 Solidifying my expertise in software architecture and optimization
- ⚙️ Building and scaling full-stack applications
- ✍️ Helping others internalize core algorithms through strategy-based coding practice
